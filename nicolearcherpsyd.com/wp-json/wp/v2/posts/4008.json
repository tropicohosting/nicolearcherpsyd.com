Perhaps you started a project a while ago but have yet to complete it. Deep down this lack of completion has caused your self-esteem to take a hit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been wanting (and very much needing) to clean out the garage. You\u2019ve probably said to yourself, \u201cI\u2019ve really got to go through the garage and throw a bunch of stuff out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">That\u2019s an okay start, but as goals go, it\u2019s pretty vague. Let\u2019s use S.M.A.R.T. goals to get the job done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Here\u2019s a\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Specific<\/span>\u00a0goal: \u201cI am going to clean out and reorganize the garage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">That\u2019s good. Now how do we make that\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Measurable<\/span>? Let\u2019s add some words that will help us know when and if we complete our goal. \u201cI am going to clean out and reorganize the garage so both cars and all of our bikes fit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">You\u2019ll also want to be able to measure your progress toward your goal to be certain you are staying on track. So, you could decide to spend two hours each Saturday and Sunday for the next 4 weeks. If you do that, you will know you\u2019re on the right path to achieving your goal. If you don\u2019t meet these milestones, you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve gotten off-track.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Now let\u2019s talk about whether or not your goal is\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Achievable<\/span>. Well, other human beings have cleaned out and organized their garage, so you know it\u2019s possible. You have the desire and you\u2019ve carved out an appropriate amount of time to complete the job. Yep, this seems like a very achievable goal!<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Instead of cleaning out the garage you already have, your goal could have been to build a new garage by yourself all in one weekend, but no, that would not have been an achievable goal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">You know your goal is achievable, but is the schedule you\u2019ve set for yourself\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Realistic<\/span>? Do you actually have 4 hours on the weekend to devote to this project, or with your work and family time, is half an hour more realistic? While it\u2019s understandable you want to get the job done as fast as possible, you also don\u2019t want to set yourself up for failure. So be sure your schedule is realistic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">And lastly, you\u2019ll need to set a\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Time-bound\u00a0<\/span>deadline for the attainment of your goal. Will this task be completed in 4 weeks? Will it take two months? Choose a deadline that\u2019s reasonable and motivating at the same time. It\u2019s a balance between being practical and pushing yourself slightly. A date too far in the future could kill your motivation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Let\u2019s recap. We started with the vague goal of \u201cI\u2019ve really got to go through the garage and throw a bunch of stuff out\u201d and ended up with \u201cI am going to spend four hours every weekend for the next four weeks cleaning out and reorganizing the garage so that both cars and all of our bikes fit.\u201d Now you have a specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound (SMART) goal with built-in milestones to get you there. But more importantly, you\u2019ve made a promise to yourself, and keeping this promise is what will enhance your self-esteem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Of course, sometimes it takes a little more work than reaching a goal to lift our self-esteem. There are experiences in our lives that can truly devastate our sense of self-worth, and often we need the guidance of a therapist to help us recover our sense of identity and self-esteem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">If you or a loved one have struggled with self-esteem issues and are interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today.
