Not the models you see on the cover of magazines, nor the actors in the movies. They have professional makeup artists and are lit perfectly Heck, most of them have been photoshopped.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Libre Franklin\", \"Helvetica Neue\", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Not even the so-called perfect among us are actually perfect.
