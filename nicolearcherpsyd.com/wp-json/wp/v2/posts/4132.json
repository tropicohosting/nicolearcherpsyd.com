Whether it\u2019s a result of phobias, depressions, or post-traumatic stress, anxiety can take a toll on our mind and health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\">If you deal with anxiety you most likely have looked into ways you can help calm your emotional rollercoaster. Perhaps you\u2019ve even tried some self-help techniques in the past. While these methods can provide some relief, it\u2019s often temporary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\">To rid yourself of overwhelming anxiety once and for all, you\u2019ve got to get to the root cause of it \u2013 the underlying factors. A therapist can help you identify and eliminate these underlying factors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\">If you are suffering from an anxiety disorder, here are 3 ways therapy can help:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\"><b>1.

For instance, your doctor can either prescribe a medication to try and manage your hypertension symptoms, or she can request you clean up your diet and exercise, addressing the root causes of your high blood pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\">A therapist will assist you in accessing your emotional world so you can study your thoughts and feelings and uncover patterns. Often, unhealthy beliefs and thoughts lie at the root of anxiety. Once you identify what is causing you anxiety, your therapist can begin to create a plan to help you face these underlying issues calmly and confidently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\"><b>2.

Therapy will help you make lifestyle and behavioral changes. You\u2019ll learn how to cope with difficult situations in a more relaxed manner. Therapy will help you to stop avoiding certain people and situations and develop a calmer and more balanced sense of self.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\"; font-size: small;\"><b>\u00a03.
