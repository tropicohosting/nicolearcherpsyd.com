										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Millions of people deal with stress and anxiety on a daily basis. Whether it’s a result of phobias, depressions, or post-traumatic stress, anxiety can take a toll on our mind and health.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you deal with anxiety you most likely have looked into ways you can help calm your emotional rollercoaster. Perhaps you’ve even tried some self-help techniques in the past. While these methods can provide some relief, it’s often temporary.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">To rid yourself of overwhelming anxiety once and for all, you’ve got to get to the root cause of it – the underlying factors. A therapist can help you identify and eliminate these underlying factors.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you are suffering from an anxiety disorder, here are 3 ways therapy can help:</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"><b>1. Uncover Root Causes</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Like any other health issue, effective treatment gets to the root cause. For instance, your doctor can either prescribe a medication to try and manage your hypertension symptoms, or she can request you clean up your diet and exercise, addressing the root causes of your high blood pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">A therapist will assist you in accessing your emotional world so you can study your thoughts and feelings and uncover patterns. Often, unhealthy beliefs and thoughts lie at the root of anxiety. Once you identify what is causing you anxiety, your therapist can begin to create a plan to help you face these underlying issues calmly and confidently.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"><b>2. Therapy Helps You Change Your Behaviors</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">We’ve just talked a little about therapy helping you uncover the thoughts and beliefs that are causing the anxiety. Those thoughts and beliefs are not only making you <i>feel</i> bad, they are causing you to have certain behaviors that may result in negative consequences.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">For instance, your anxiety leads to insomnia or denial of intimate social connections. Therapy will help you make lifestyle and behavioral changes. You’ll learn how to cope with difficult situations in a more relaxed manner. Therapy will help you to stop avoiding certain people and situations and develop a calmer and more balanced sense of self.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"><b> 3. Therapy Offers Continued Personalized Support</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"> All change is hard, even change that’s ultimately good for you. One of the biggest benefits of therapy is that it offers continual personalized support. Your therapist wants to see you succeed and will offer encouragement and advice without judgement.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you’ve been living with anxiety, know that you don’t have to deal with it alone. If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</span></p>

Perhaps you get a bit nervous speaking in front of people or going on a job interview. But for some people, anxiety becomes a frequent and forceful occurrence that completely takes over their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">Since anxiety comes in many forms, for instance panic attacks, phobias and social anxiety, it can often be difficult to tell if what you’re experiencing is “normal” or has crossed the line into a mood disorder.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, you may want to speak with a counselor who can help you cope with your anxiety.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><b>Excessive Worry</b></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">General anxiety disorder (GAD), the broadest type of anxiety, is characterized by excessive worry. People with GAD worry too much about everyday things, both big and small. But what constitutes “too much worry?”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">With GAD, people are plagued with persistent, anxious thoughts most days of the week. This anxiety can become so overwhelming it interferes with their daily life. If you are worrying to a degree that you have trouble doing daily tasks and are suffering with your emotions, it may be time to speak with a therapist.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1"><b>Trouble Sleeping</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">Sleep issues such as falling asleep or staying asleep have been associated with a myriad of health conditions, both physical and psychological. It’s normal for people to have trouble sleeping from time to time. Perhaps you find yourself tossing and turning before a big job interview or giving a presentation.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">However, if you find yourself night after night lying awake, anxious about specific problems (such as relationship problems or financial difficulties), or even about nothing in particular, it may be a sign of an anxiety disorder.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><b>Muscle Tension</b></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">Anxiety disorders can often be accompanied by persistent muscle tension. Do you find yourself clenching your jaw or balling your fists throughout the day? You may have lived with this chronic muscular tension for so long you don’t even realize it anymore. While exercise can help relax muscles, therapy will get to the root cause of the anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1"><b>Digestive Problems</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">While anxiety lives in the mind, it is often manifested in the body through chronic digestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Our guts are very sensitive to emotional and psychological stress. Unfortunately, digestive upset can often make a person feel even more anxious.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1"><b>Panic Attacks</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">Panic attacks can be a frightening experience. You are suddenly gripped with an overwhelming feeling of dread and fear. These are often accompanied by physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, racing heart, dizziness, and profuse sweating. Though not everyone who has an anxiety disorder will experience panic attacks, but those that do live in constant fear.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">Anxiety disorders keep people from living a joyful and fulfilling life. Luckily there is help. A therapist can assist in uncovering the root cause of the anxiety and offer tools to cope.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1">If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today.

I have helped a lot of clients better manage anxiety, stress, perfectionism, and other challenges.  Contact me for a complimentary <a href="https://nicolearcherpsyd.com/appointment-request/">consultation</a> so we can talk about working together.</p>
