										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Quick question: Do you like yourself?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">When asked this question, most people respond by saying something like, “Of course I like myself.” While their words say they like themselves, what do their actions say?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Are you someone who’s comfortable in their own skin? Are you happy with your appearance, or are you constantly comparing yourself to others, wishing you could be more like them? When you look in the mirror, what do you see? A superstar, or someone who doesn’t quite live up to your own expectations?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">The thing is, our self-esteem is based on how we feel about ourselves, right now in this moment. Sure, it’s okay to strive to become a better version of ourselves, so long as we accept this current version, flaws and all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you’re someone who is overly self-critical, here are 5 ways you can learn to like yourself better:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Enjoy Your Accomplishments</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Some people are so focused on everything that’s <em>wrong</em> with them, they never take a look at what’s <em>right</em>. When you’ve done something well, it’s important that you admit this success and enjoy it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">It doesn’t have to be something huge, either. It could be that you made a <em>really delicious</em> lasagna. Allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying every single bite, and happily receive any compliments from those you cooked for.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Understand That No One is Perfect</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you’ve been comparing yourself to other people, it’s time for you to stop and realize that no one is perfect. Not the models you see on the cover of magazines, nor the actors in the movies. They have professional makeup artists and are lit perfectly Heck, most of them have been photoshopped.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Not even the so-called perfect among us are actually perfect. The sooner you can accept this fact the sooner you can relax and like who you are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Have Patience with Yourself</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Perhaps there are things about yourself that you would like to change. Do you want to lose weight, get healthier, learn a new language?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Often we hate ourselves for not reaching impossible goals we have set for ourselves. If there are goals you would like to reach, be realistic in setting timelines and be patient with yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">4. Look at Your Past with a Kind Eye</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Sometimes we don’t like ourselves because of past actions and behaviors. It’s important to give yourself some slack. When you were young, you may not have always acted kindly toward loved ones or strangers. Maybe you acted selfishly more often than you care to admit. But this is a part of being young.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">The best thing to do is embrace your past, warts and all, and see what you can learn from your actions and behaviors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">5. Like “Most” of Yourself</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">You may never like 100% of yourself, and that’s okay. Strive to like 80% or 90%. You can still live an incredibly happy life when you think ‘only’ 85% of you is awesome.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">A healthy self-esteem is important to our overall well-being, but getting there can be difficult, especially if you’ve suffered from a low self-esteem your entire life. Working with a therapist can be very beneficial. Someone who is impartial and completely new to you can help you gain clarity and a new perspective on yourself and your life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">When was the last time you heard from your inner critic? You know, that voice in your head that constantly judges you, puts you down and compares you to others. The one that tells you you’re not good enough or smart enough and says things you would never <em>dream</em> of saying to another person.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Now you may think this inner critic, while annoying, is relatively harmless. But this is simply not the case. This inner critical voice limits you and stops you from living the life you truly desire. It hinders your emotional well-being and, if left unchecked, can even lead to depression or anxiety.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Here are some ways you can silence that inner critic and stop beating yourself up.</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Give it Attention</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">That’s right, in order to gain control over your inner critic you have to know that it exists. Most of our thinking is automatic. In other words, we don’t give our thoughts much thought. We barely notice a critical thought has passed. Give attention to your thoughts, all of them. This will help you recognize the critical voice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Here are some emotional clues the critic has reared its ugly head: whenever you feel doubt, guilt, shame, and worthlessness. These are almost always signs of the critic at work.</p>
<ol start="2" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Separate Yourself from Your Inner Critic</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Your inner critic is like a parasite, feeding off you. You were not born with this parasite but acquired it along the way. Your inner critic hopes it can hide and blend in, and that you’ll think <u>ITS</u> thoughts are your own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">You have to separate yourself from this parasite. One way to do that is to give your critic a name. Have fun with this naming. You could call your inner critic anything from “Todd” to “Miss. Annoying Loudmouth.” It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">What matters is that you learn to separate it from your authentic self.</p>
<ol start="3" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Talk Back</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">In order to take the power away from your inner critic, you’ve got to give it a taste of its own medicine. As soon as you recognize your inner critic is speaking to you, tell it to shut up. Tell it that the jig is up, that you know it is a big, fat liar, and that you want it to go away. If you want to really make this voice recoil, tell it you are choosing to be kind to yourself from now on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Self-compassion to an inner critic is like garlic to a vampire.</p>
<ol start="4" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Create a New Inner Voice</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you want to defeat an enemy, you need to have a powerful ally on your side. It’s important at this juncture to create an even more powerful inner voice. One that is on your side and acts as your BFF.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">To create this new voice, start noticing the good things about yourself. No matter what that nasty critic said about you, the truth is you have fantastic traits and abilities. Start focusing on those. Yes, it will be hard at first to let yourself see you in a positive light, but the more you do it, the easier it will get.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Life is short. To have the most fulfilling one possible, we have to stop wasting time on beating ourselves up. Take these 4 steps and learn to quiet that inner critic. Your best you is waiting to be celebrated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Some people’s inner critic is stronger than others. Sometimes the greatest ally you can have in your corner is an impartial third party, a therapist who can see you for who you really are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you or a loved one could use some help defeating your inner critic and would like to explore therapy, get in touch with me. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Many people set goals to get in better physical shape. They want tighter buns, six pack abs and arms that never jiggle. But how many people decide to work on their inner selves?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">No matter what we look like on the outside, it’s who we are on the <em>inside</em> that really dictates our lives. Self-esteem reflects the relationship we have with ourselves. The better this relationship is, the better our other relationships can be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Most of us could use a good self-esteem boost. What’s the best way to do that? Through goal setting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">But these goals can’t be just any ol’ goals. To really set ourselves up for success, we need to set <span style="font-weight: 700;">S.M.A.R.T.</span> goals. Smart stands for <span style="font-weight: 700;">S</span>pecific, <span style="font-weight: 700;">M</span>easurable, <span style="font-weight: 700;">A</span>chievable, <span style="font-weight: 700;">R</span>ealistic, and <span style="font-weight: 700;">T</span>ime-bound.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">What does this look like in real life?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Is there something you’ve been wanting to do but haven’t gotten around to? Perhaps you started a project a while ago but have yet to complete it. Deep down this lack of completion has caused your self-esteem to take a hit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Let’s say you’ve been wanting (and very much needing) to clean out the garage. You’ve probably said to yourself, “I’ve really got to go through the garage and throw a bunch of stuff out.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">That’s an okay start, but as goals go, it’s pretty vague. Let’s use S.M.A.R.T. goals to get the job done.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Here’s a <span style="font-weight: 700;">Specific</span> goal: “I am going to clean out and reorganize the garage.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">That’s good. Now how do we make that <span style="font-weight: 700;">Measurable</span>? Let’s add some words that will help us know when and if we complete our goal. “I am going to clean out and reorganize the garage so both cars and all of our bikes fit.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">You’ll also want to be able to measure your progress toward your goal to be certain you are staying on track. So, you could decide to spend two hours each Saturday and Sunday for the next 4 weeks. If you do that, you will know you’re on the right path to achieving your goal. If you don’t meet these milestones, you’ll know you’ve gotten off-track.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Now let’s talk about whether or not your goal is <span style="font-weight: 700;">Achievable</span>. Well, other human beings have cleaned out and organized their garage, so you know it’s possible. You have the desire and you’ve carved out an appropriate amount of time to complete the job. Yep, this seems like a very achievable goal!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Instead of cleaning out the garage you already have, your goal could have been to build a new garage by yourself all in one weekend, but no, that would not have been an achievable goal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">You know your goal is achievable, but is the schedule you’ve set for yourself <span style="font-weight: 700;">Realistic</span>? Do you actually have 4 hours on the weekend to devote to this project, or with your work and family time, is half an hour more realistic? While it’s understandable you want to get the job done as fast as possible, you also don’t want to set yourself up for failure. So be sure your schedule is realistic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">And lastly, you’ll need to set a <span style="font-weight: 700;">Time-bound </span>deadline for the attainment of your goal. Will this task be completed in 4 weeks? Will it take two months? Choose a deadline that’s reasonable and motivating at the same time. It’s a balance between being practical and pushing yourself slightly. A date too far in the future could kill your motivation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Let’s recap. We started with the vague goal of “I’ve really got to go through the garage and throw a bunch of stuff out” and ended up with “I am going to spend four hours every weekend for the next four weeks cleaning out and reorganizing the garage so that both cars and all of our bikes fit.” Now you have a specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound (SMART) goal with built-in milestones to get you there. But more importantly, you’ve made a promise to yourself, and keeping this promise is what will enhance your self-esteem.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Of course, sometimes it takes a little more work than reaching a goal to lift our self-esteem. There are experiences in our lives that can truly devastate our sense of self-worth, and often we need the guidance of a therapist to help us recover our sense of identity and self-esteem.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you or a loved one have struggled with self-esteem issues and are interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">Most children are brought up to be kind and respectful of other people. They are taught to consider others’ feelings and help those in need. But when it comes to taking care of themselves, many people lack the ability to put their own needs first.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">To some, the concept of self-care is as foreign as the language and customs of far away lands. The idea of putting their own needs first feels somehow wrong, or even selfish.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">The good news is that it’s never too late to learn to treat yourself as you do others; to put yourself first in a healthy, energizing way. Here are some ways you can rewire your brain so it becomes increasingly easier to put yourself first, thereby recharging your life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn to Say No</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">Being a caring and compassionate person is wonderful, but sacrificing yourself by saying “yes” all the time to other people’s needs will deplete your energy. Learning to set boundaries and say no is not only your right, it’s your responsibility. Try to start saying no more often, free of guilt.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ask for Help</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">When you’ve taken on the role of helping others, it can feel uncomfortable asking for help when you need it. After all, <em>you’re</em> the one people go to when in need.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">The thing to remember is, all of these people who come to you for help feel no shame or discomfort in asking for it. They need help, they ask for it, they get it. Try to do the same. As soon as you release the pressure you’ve put on yourself to handle everything alone, you will feel a tremendous weight lifted.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get to Know Yourself!</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">Do you know what makes you tick? What do you like and dislike? People who are wired to neglect their own needs don’t typically know themselves very well. Knowing oneself is seen as a luxury they can’t afford.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">Self-love and self-care require you get to know your SELF. Take some time to discover what you enjoy. Once you find what it is that pleases you, commit to doing it more often. Having more pleasure in your life will make you a happier person.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">Taking these actions will have a tremendous impact on your life. As you get better and better at putting your needs first, you will feel happier and more empowered. You will know, deep down, that your own needs matter and you are worth the effort.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">Some people have a tremendously hard time with these exercises because they have a very low self-esteem. And the longer you have lived with a low self-esteem, the harder it is to make positive changes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">In these instances, seeking the guidance of a trained therapist can be incredibly beneficial. He or she can help you work through any childhood trauma and provide tools to manage any anxiety or depression that often accompanies a low self-esteem.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: #333333;">If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please <a href="https://nicolearcherpsyd.com/contact/">contact me</a> today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</p>
