Does seeing a therapist make me seem weak?<\/h3>\n<p>No! Everyone needs help or support now and then. In fact, I think it takes courage to ask for help. You already have strengths that you\u2019ve used before, but for whatever reason may struggle to access it right now. This happens when we get overwhelmed, are dealing with difficult situations, or experiencing high levels of stress. In our work together, I\u2019ll help you identify what those strengths are and how to implement them again in what is happening now.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is talking to a therapist different than talking to my friends or family?<\/h3>\n<p>A professional therapist can help you approach your situation in a new way by teaching new skills, helping you to view different perspectives, listening without judgment or expectations, and helping you listen to yourself. Furthermore, therapy is completely confidential. You won\u2019t have to worry about others \u201cknowing my business.\u201d Lastly, if your situation provokes a great deal of negative emotion, if you\u2019ve been confiding in a friend or family member, there is the risk that once you are feeling better you could start avoiding that person so you aren\u2019t reminded of this difficult time in your life.<\/p>\n<h3>Should I just take medication instead of therapy?<\/h3>\n<p>Medication is helpful for a lot of people, but often alone cannot solve all issues. Medication treats the symptoms. Our work together is designed to explore the root of the problems or symptoms, explore more deeply into your behaviors and worries, and to teach strategies that can help you accomplish your personal and\/or relational goals.<br \/>\nMedication can be effective and is sometimes needed in conjunction with therapy. If I feel medication may be helpful for you I will recommend you speak to a physician.<\/p>\n<h3>How does it work? What do I have to do in sessions?<\/h3>\n<p>Because each person has different issues and goals for therapy, therapy will be different depending on the individual. I tailor my therapeutic approach to your specific needs. During our consultation and our first session I will provide specific recommendations based on your individual goals and needs.<br \/>\nI use a collaborative process to help you make progress towards your goals during our sessions.<\/p>\n<h3>How long do I need to be in therapy?<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible to say in a general FAQs page. Everyone\u2019s circumstances are unique to them and the length of time therapy can take to allow you to accomplish your goals depends on your desire for personal development, your commitment, and the factors that are driving you to seek therapy in the first place.<\/p>\n<h3>I want to get the most out of therapy. What can I do to help?<\/h3>\n<p>I am so glad you are dedicated to getting the most out of your sessions. Your active participation and dedication is crucial to your success. After all, we only see each other for a session a week. It\u2019s the work you do outside of our sessions that will really help you see your personal growth and development. I will assist you in setting up short term goals between our meetings to work towards your goals most efficiently.<\/p>\n<h3>My partner and I are having problems. Do you provide relationship counseling?<\/h3>\n<p>At this time, I only provide individual counseling. I am happy to provide individual support for you while dealing with these concerns. I also will assist you in finding a therapist to see as a couple if I think it could be beneficial.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m used to handling things on my own.
