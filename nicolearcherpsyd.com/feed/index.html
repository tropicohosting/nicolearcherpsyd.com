										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Until quite recently, people were uncomfortable discussing therapy because of the stigma attached by our society. As a result, there are still some fairly big misconceptions about it. Here are 3 of the most common misconceptions about therapy to help you feel more comfortable and hopefully, take that step to seek treatment.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><strong style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">It’s Just Like Talking to Your Friend</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">While friends are there to listen and support you, they are not equipped to offer real solutions to your problems. Therapists, on the other hand, are uniquely qualified to help you by offering more than just good advice.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Therapists have trained to have a deeper understanding of human nature. They can help you recognize your own behavioral patterns as well as offer tools to make necessary adjustments. They can also help you to gain a fresh perspective on the events of your life and the choices you’ve made.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">And finally, we don’t always want our friends or family to know what’s going on in our lives. Because therapy is confidential and because your therapist’s only vested interest in you is helping you improve yourself and overcome your challenges, it is generally easier talking openly with them. Only by being totally honest and transparent about your life and yourself can you hope to create lasting change.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><strong style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Therapy is All About Blaming Your Parents for Your Current Behavior</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Many people assume therapy consists of spending 45 minutes each week blaming their parents for all their problems. Therapy isn’t about playing the blame game, however therapists <em>do</em> have to look at a client’s history to get a clear picture of their experiences and patterns.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">While many people new to therapy may not want to spend any time “wallowing in the past,” they must understand that the first phase of therapy is to gather information. A therapist must ask some questions about their new client’s life history in order to truly understand him or her. Past experiences <em>do</em> have a way of shaping our personalities, and while your therapist is not interested in having you lay blame on anyone, you will need to provide a brief psychosocial history in order for the solution-focused therapy to be successful.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><strong style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">You’ll Start to Feel Better Immediately</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Many people new to therapy make the mistake of quitting when they don’t feel better after one or two sessions. The truth is, it will take one or two sessions just to tell your story and develop a sense of trust. Therapy shouldn’t be thought of as a quick fix but a process that is unique to each individual. And, it is important to understand that the process won’t always feel good, though it will be completely worthwhile in the end.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Millions of people deal with stress and anxiety on a daily basis. Whether it’s a result of phobias, depressions, or post-traumatic stress, anxiety can take a toll on our mind and health.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you deal with anxiety you most likely have looked into ways you can help calm your emotional rollercoaster. Perhaps you’ve even tried some self-help techniques in the past. While these methods can provide some relief, it’s often temporary.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">To rid yourself of overwhelming anxiety once and for all, you’ve got to get to the root cause of it – the underlying factors. A therapist can help you identify and eliminate these underlying factors.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you are suffering from an anxiety disorder, here are 3 ways therapy can help:</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"><b>1. Uncover Root Causes</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">Like any other health issue, effective treatment gets to the root cause. For instance, your doctor can either prescribe a medication to try and manage your hypertension symptoms, or she can request you clean up your diet and exercise, addressing the root causes of your high blood pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">A therapist will assist you in accessing your emotional world so you can study your thoughts and feelings and uncover patterns. Often, unhealthy beliefs and thoughts lie at the root of anxiety. Once you identify what is causing you anxiety, your therapist can begin to create a plan to help you face these underlying issues calmly and confidently.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"><b>2. Therapy Helps You Change Your Behaviors</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">We’ve just talked a little about therapy helping you uncover the thoughts and beliefs that are causing the anxiety. Those thoughts and beliefs are not only making you <i>feel</i> bad, they are causing you to have certain behaviors that may result in negative consequences.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">For instance, your anxiety leads to insomnia or denial of intimate social connections. Therapy will help you make lifestyle and behavioral changes. You’ll learn how to cope with difficult situations in a more relaxed manner. Therapy will help you to stop avoiding certain people and situations and develop a calmer and more balanced sense of self.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"><b> 3. Therapy Offers Continued Personalized Support</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;"> All change is hard, even change that’s ultimately good for you. One of the biggest benefits of therapy is that it offers continual personalized support. Your therapist wants to see you succeed and will offer encouragement and advice without judgement.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; font-size: small;">If you’ve been living with anxiety, know that you don’t have to deal with it alone. If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Quick question: Do you like yourself?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">When asked this question, most people respond by saying something like, “Of course I like myself.” While their words say they like themselves, what do their actions say?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Are you someone who’s comfortable in their own skin? Are you happy with your appearance, or are you constantly comparing yourself to others, wishing you could be more like them? When you look in the mirror, what do you see? A superstar, or someone who doesn’t quite live up to your own expectations?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">The thing is, our self-esteem is based on how we feel about ourselves, right now in this moment. Sure, it’s okay to strive to become a better version of ourselves, so long as we accept this current version, flaws and all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you’re someone who is overly self-critical, here are 5 ways you can learn to like yourself better:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Enjoy Your Accomplishments</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Some people are so focused on everything that’s <em>wrong</em> with them, they never take a look at what’s <em>right</em>. When you’ve done something well, it’s important that you admit this success and enjoy it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">It doesn’t have to be something huge, either. It could be that you made a <em>really delicious</em> lasagna. Allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying every single bite, and happily receive any compliments from those you cooked for.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Understand That No One is Perfect</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you’ve been comparing yourself to other people, it’s time for you to stop and realize that no one is perfect. Not the models you see on the cover of magazines, nor the actors in the movies. They have professional makeup artists and are lit perfectly Heck, most of them have been photoshopped.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Not even the so-called perfect among us are actually perfect. The sooner you can accept this fact the sooner you can relax and like who you are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Have Patience with Yourself</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Perhaps there are things about yourself that you would like to change. Do you want to lose weight, get healthier, learn a new language?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Often we hate ourselves for not reaching impossible goals we have set for ourselves. If there are goals you would like to reach, be realistic in setting timelines and be patient with yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">4. Look at Your Past with a Kind Eye</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Sometimes we don’t like ourselves because of past actions and behaviors. It’s important to give yourself some slack. When you were young, you may not have always acted kindly toward loved ones or strangers. Maybe you acted selfishly more often than you care to admit. But this is a part of being young.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">The best thing to do is embrace your past, warts and all, and see what you can learn from your actions and behaviors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">5. Like “Most” of Yourself</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">You may never like 100% of yourself, and that’s okay. Strive to like 80% or 90%. You can still live an incredibly happy life when you think ‘only’ 85% of you is awesome.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">A healthy self-esteem is important to our overall well-being, but getting there can be difficult, especially if you’ve suffered from a low self-esteem your entire life. Working with a therapist can be very beneficial. Someone who is impartial and completely new to you can help you gain clarity and a new perspective on yourself and your life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you or a loved one is interested in exploring treatment, please contact me today. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">When was the last time you heard from your inner critic? You know, that voice in your head that constantly judges you, puts you down and compares you to others. The one that tells you you’re not good enough or smart enough and says things you would never <em>dream</em> of saying to another person.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Now you may think this inner critic, while annoying, is relatively harmless. But this is simply not the case. This inner critical voice limits you and stops you from living the life you truly desire. It hinders your emotional well-being and, if left unchecked, can even lead to depression or anxiety.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Here are some ways you can silence that inner critic and stop beating yourself up.</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Give it Attention</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">That’s right, in order to gain control over your inner critic you have to know that it exists. Most of our thinking is automatic. In other words, we don’t give our thoughts much thought. We barely notice a critical thought has passed. Give attention to your thoughts, all of them. This will help you recognize the critical voice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Here are some emotional clues the critic has reared its ugly head: whenever you feel doubt, guilt, shame, and worthlessness. These are almost always signs of the critic at work.</p>
<ol start="2" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Separate Yourself from Your Inner Critic</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Your inner critic is like a parasite, feeding off you. You were not born with this parasite but acquired it along the way. Your inner critic hopes it can hide and blend in, and that you’ll think <u>ITS</u> thoughts are your own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">You have to separate yourself from this parasite. One way to do that is to give your critic a name. Have fun with this naming. You could call your inner critic anything from “Todd” to “Miss. Annoying Loudmouth.” It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">What matters is that you learn to separate it from your authentic self.</p>
<ol start="3" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Talk Back</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">In order to take the power away from your inner critic, you’ve got to give it a taste of its own medicine. As soon as you recognize your inner critic is speaking to you, tell it to shut up. Tell it that the jig is up, that you know it is a big, fat liar, and that you want it to go away. If you want to really make this voice recoil, tell it you are choosing to be kind to yourself from now on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Self-compassion to an inner critic is like garlic to a vampire.</p>
<ol start="4" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Create a New Inner Voice</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you want to defeat an enemy, you need to have a powerful ally on your side. It’s important at this juncture to create an even more powerful inner voice. One that is on your side and acts as your BFF.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">To create this new voice, start noticing the good things about yourself. No matter what that nasty critic said about you, the truth is you have fantastic traits and abilities. Start focusing on those. Yes, it will be hard at first to let yourself see you in a positive light, but the more you do it, the easier it will get.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Life is short. To have the most fulfilling one possible, we have to stop wasting time on beating ourselves up. Take these 4 steps and learn to quiet that inner critic. Your best you is waiting to be celebrated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">Some people’s inner critic is stronger than others. Sometimes the greatest ally you can have in your corner is an impartial third party, a therapist who can see you for who you really are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: "Libre Franklin", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you or a loved one could use some help defeating your inner critic and would like to explore therapy, get in touch with me. I would be happy to speak with you about how I may be able to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">Did you know that on most days, the average person has between 25,000 and 50,000 thoughts? That’s an impressive amount of thoughts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">But when happens when the majority of these thoughts are negative? Imagine the impact on your psyche <em>and</em> your life if you had thousands and thousands of negative thoughts each day?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">This amount of negative thinking is a hallmark of depression. Negative or pessimistic thinking is depression speaking <em>for</em> you. It is the voice of depression. What many people don’t realize is that depression is manifested in negative thinking before it ever creates a negative thought itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">This is why it is imperative for those suffering from depression to become acutely aware of their thought patterns. If not checked, negative thinking becomes a habit, one that has the potential to completely shape your life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Change How You Think</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">One of the most powerful ways people can lift themselves out of the darkness of depression is to change their thinking patterns. This is why cognitive therapy is such a profound change agent. The approach is based on the fact that thought-processing errors contribute to a depressed mood.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">By changing how you <em>think</em>, you automatically change how you <em>feel</em>. Once you become aware that changing your thinking is important, you are presented with an active choice you can take to benefit your mental health.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">You will no doubt find that changing your thought patterns can feel about as easy as changing a tire in the rain with nothing more than a hardboiled egg and a paper clip. But it <em>can</em> be done.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">Here are some tips on how you can begin to change your negative thoughts:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Keep Track of Your Thoughts</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">Many people are in denial about their thought patterns. They don’t want to believe they are overly negative or pessimistic. Catching yourself and recording as many negative thoughts as you can will help you to see your own mental patterns.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">What will these thoughts look like? You could write things like, “I hate my feet.” “My boss is an idiot.” “I hate spring.” “I hate getting up this early.” “I don’t know what I’m doing.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">Be particularly mindful of making sweeping generalizations from one specific event so that your entire future looks doomed. For example, a generalized thought such as, “My girlfriend broke up with me so I’m doomed to spend the rest of my life alone.” This kind of extreme, black and white thinking is a sure sign of depression.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Identify Triggers</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">Once you get an idea for the frequency of your negative thoughts, try and pinpoint the triggers for them. Your journal will also come in handy here, because it will point out certain types of events that set off a chain of negative thoughts. Triggers can include being rejected or ignored, or having an unkind remark said about or to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Positive Conversion</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">You have so far learned that the human thinking process is habitual. But the good news is, you can create <em>good</em> thinking habits.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">To do this you’ve got to start converting all of those negative thoughts into positive ones. It will be hard at first, and you will most likely feel as if you’re lying to yourself and pretending to be a glass-half-full Pollyanna.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">But, as they say, “You’ve got to fake it until you make it.” Though thinking positively may feel foreign to you and like a waste of your time, you are retraining your brain to think (and feel) good.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">Every time you have a negative thought, stop, recognize it as negative, and immediately flip the switch and create the positive opposite thought in its place. This could look like:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Negative thought</span>: “I’ll never get this report done on time.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Positive Switch</span>: “I’m making great progress and being careful to always check my work.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">To get the hang of how to do this, go through your negativity journal and create a separate column in which you will write the positive opposites of your many negative thoughts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you feel too dark and down to complete these exercises, please consider reaching out to a trained therapist who can prescribe medication, should you require it, and help you work through your negativity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;">If you or a loved one are suffering from depression and are interested in exploring treatment options, please contact me. I would be happy to discuss how I may be able to help.</p>
