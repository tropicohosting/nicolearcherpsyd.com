That\u2019s an impressive amount of thoughts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">But when happens when the majority of these thoughts are negative? Imagine the impact on your psyche\u00a0<em>and<\/em>\u00a0your life if you had thousands and thousands of negative thoughts each day?<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">This amount of negative thinking is a hallmark of depression. Negative or pessimistic thinking is depression speaking\u00a0<em>for<\/em>\u00a0you. It is the voice of depression. What many people don\u2019t realize is that depression is manifested in negative thinking before it ever creates a negative thought itself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">This is why it is imperative for those suffering from depression to become acutely aware of their thought patterns. If not checked, negative thinking becomes a habit, one that has the potential to completely shape your life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Change How You Think<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">One of the most powerful ways people can lift themselves out of the darkness of depression is to change their thinking patterns. This is why cognitive therapy is such a profound change agent. The approach is based on the fact that thought-processing errors contribute to a depressed mood.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">By changing how you\u00a0<em>think<\/em>, you automatically change how you\u00a0<em>feel<\/em>. Once you become aware that changing your thinking is important, you are presented with an active choice you can take to benefit your mental health.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">You will no doubt find that changing your thought patterns can feel about as easy as changing a tire in the rain with nothing more than a hardboiled egg and a paper clip. But it\u00a0<em>can<\/em>\u00a0be done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Here are some tips on how you can begin to change your negative thoughts:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Keep Track of Your Thoughts<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Many people are in denial about their thought patterns. They don\u2019t want to believe they are overly negative or pessimistic. Catching yourself and recording as many negative thoughts as you can will help you to see your own mental patterns.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">What will these thoughts look like? You could write things like, \u201cI hate my feet.\u201d \u201cMy boss is an idiot.\u201d \u201cI hate spring.\u201d \u201cI hate getting up this early.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Be particularly mindful of making sweeping generalizations from one specific event so that your entire future looks doomed. For example, a generalized thought such as, \u201cMy girlfriend broke up with me so I\u2019m doomed to spend the rest of my life alone.\u201d This kind of extreme, black and white thinking is a sure sign of depression.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Identify Triggers<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Once you get an idea for the frequency of your negative thoughts, try and pinpoint the triggers for them. Your journal will also come in handy here, because it will point out certain types of events that set off a chain of negative thoughts. Triggers can include being rejected or ignored, or having an unkind remark said about or to you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Positive Conversion<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">You have so far learned that the human thinking process is habitual. But the good news is, you can create\u00a0<em>good<\/em>\u00a0thinking habits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">To do this you\u2019ve got to start converting all of those negative thoughts into positive ones. It will be hard at first, and you will most likely feel as if you\u2019re lying to yourself and pretending to be a glass-half-full Pollyanna.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">But, as they say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to fake it until you make it.\u201d Though thinking positively may feel foreign to you and like a waste of your time, you are retraining your brain to think (and feel) good.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">Every time you have a negative thought, stop, recognize it as negative, and immediately flip the switch and create the positive opposite thought in its place. This could look like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Negative thought<\/span>: \u201cI\u2019ll never get this report done on time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Positive Switch<\/span>: \u201cI\u2019m making great progress and being careful to always check my work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">To get the hang of how to do this, go through your negativity journal and create a separate column in which you will write the positive opposites of your many negative thoughts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">If you feel too dark and down to complete these exercises, please consider reaching out to a trained therapist who can prescribe medication, should you require it, and help you work through your negativity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 28px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: normal;\">If you or a loved one are suffering from depression and are interested in exploring treatment options, please contact me.
